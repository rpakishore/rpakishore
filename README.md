# Hi there, I'm Arun - Structural EIT and Coding Enthusiast! 

I'm a passionate structural engineer-in-training who loves to push the boundaries of both design and code. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Shell, and Docker, exploring the intersection between structural engineering and software development.

##  What I'm currently working on

I'm constantly seeking innovative ways to enhance the field of structural engineering through automation and optimization.

        Some of my recent projects include:
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a Python wrapper for SAP2000 to streamline the analysis and design of complex structures.</li>
          <li>Building userscripts using JavaScript to enhance existing web calculators.</li>
          <li>Experimenting with Docker to create reproducible environments for engineering simulations.</li>
          <li>Developing web apps to aid with project metric tracking and report generation.</li>
        </ul>

##  I'm currently learning

Continuous learning is an essential part of my journey. Here are a few technologies and concepts I'm currently diving into:

- Machine learning algorithms for predicting structural behavior.
- Using LLMs to perform risk analysis and prediction on structural projects.
- Advanced data visualization techniques to communicate complex engineering concepts effectively.
- Cloud computing and its applications in large-scale structural analysis.

##  Fun facts about me

- I'm a big fan of puzzles and brain teasers. Solving them helps me exercise my problem-solving skills.
- I believe in the power of open-source software and actively contribute to various engineering and coding communities.
- When I'm not engineering or coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or enjoying a good book.
